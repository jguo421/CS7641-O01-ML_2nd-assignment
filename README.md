## CS 7641 Assignment 2: Randomized Optimization

This project is saved at https://github.com/jguo421/CS7641-O01-ML_2nd-assignment

4 RO algorithms were performed on 3 problems (4-peaks, continouse-peaks and TSP)
- Randomized Hill Climb (RHC)
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Genetic Algorithms (GA)
- Mutual Information Maximizing Input Clustering (MIMIC)

You need to install the following libraries.
- ABAGAIL: https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL
- Apache Ant: https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Elcipse is the IDE

1. Gj4peaks.java
2. GJContinousePeak.java
3. GJSalesMan.java
   above 3 java programs are for the RO analysis
   
4. The dataset (heart1.csv) was uploaded together with the program
   NNforHear_finaltest.java,   NNfor_SA.java, NNfor_GA.java are the same data used in the 1st assignment
   You need to make sure the dataset is saved in appropriate path for the java program 
      
6. assignment2_plot.ipynb is for the graph plotting
